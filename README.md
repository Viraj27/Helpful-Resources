# Helpful-Resources
Repo built for things which could be helpful at some point of time. Could be a document, could be a script, could be a cheatsheet!

P.S: I found Helpful_scripts.ipynb as a google colab notebook and I can't seem to find the author of this! If he/she were to come across this, please let me know. Would like to give them credit for this.
